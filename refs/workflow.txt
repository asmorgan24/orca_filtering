Workflow:

I'd like to input some command which calls out the substituents, eg

BDFE(OCH3,F,CH3)

to generate three input files ("Co", "rad", and "free") with the stated substituents at the 3, 4, 5 positions.

Filtering results:

The numbers that I need are BDFE(CH) and BDFE(MC)

BDFE(CH) = 627.509474*{(Gibbs free enthalpy from "free" output) - [(Gibbs free enthalpy from "rad" output) - 0.513321]}

BDFE(MC) = 627.509474*{(Gibbs free enthalpy from "Co" output) - [(Gibbs free enthalpy from "rad" output) - 3314.8690]}

Also: the number of imaginary frequencies more negative than -20 from each output "Co" "rad" and "free"
